				    <p>Actions node is the parent node for all actions defined for the selected tab. Actions govern the interactions between components.</p>

<p>Multiple UI components communicate through events fired and consumed. For example, selecting a node on a TreeGrid component fires an event that can be consumed by another component. Another example would the firing of an event which triggers an action targeting the same component or another component. What triggers an action, what is the action logic, and what component is impacted by the action are all configured through the Action Configuration dialog.</p>

<p>Actions node has no properties of its own.</p>

<h4><a name="Actions-AvailableActions"></a>Available Actions</h4>
<p><b>Add Action</b>: Adds a new Action.</p>

<p>In order to guide the user while defining an action, an action configuration dialog will pop-up to collect information, before the node for the action is added. Once the Action is added its additional properties can be set in the property editor. The action configuration dialog can be re-opened to edit the configuration.</p>

<h2><a name="Actions-ActionConfigurationKeyConcepts"></a>Action Configuration Key Concepts</h2>
<h5><a name="Actions-Type"></a>Type</h5>
<p>RapidInsight UI components support various actions such as making a server-side call on a node clicked event, making a function call to another UI component based on a menu click, etc. To support these different behaviors, multiple action types are supported:<br/>
<b>request</b>: When triggered, this action will make a server side call.<br/>
<b>merge</b>: When triggered, this action will make a server side call (specified by the url field) and update its content (merge the data it has with the data returned from the server).<br/>
<b>link</b>: <br/>
<b>function</b>: When triggered, this action will invoke a function/method of another UI component. The component and its method will also be specified in this dialog.<br/>
<b>combined</b>: When triggered, multiple actions can be executed.</p>

<h5><a name="Actions-TriggerType"></a>Trigger Type</h5>
<p>Designates what triggers the action; an event, such as a node-clicked event, or a menu, such as "Details" menu on a device.<br/>
If the trigger type is event, a component and one of its supported events is added to the Triggering Events list. More than one "component/its supported event" pair can be added to the list.</p>

<h5><a name="Actions-SpecifywhattheActionshoulddo"></a>Specify what the Action should do</h5>
<p>Depending on the type of the action, this means specifying:</p>
<ul>
	<li>a target component and its method</li>
	<li>the url of the server-side call</li>
</ul>
