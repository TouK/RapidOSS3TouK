<p>What triggers an action is defined by adding one or more trigger nodes to the action. In RapidInsight there are 4 types of events that can trigger an action. These trigger types are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Menu: action will be triggered when a menu item is clicked</li>
	<li>Component event: action will be triggered when an event supported by a component is fired, such as "rowClicked" event of the SearchGrid</li>
	<li>Action event: action will be triggered by an event fired by a preceding action, such as the "success" event of the FunctionAction</li>
	<li>Global event: action will be triggered when a global event is fired, such as serverDown, which indicates communication to the server is lost.</li>
</ul>
