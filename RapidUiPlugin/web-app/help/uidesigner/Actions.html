<p>Actions node is the parent node for all actions defined for the selected tab. Actions govern the interactions between components.</p>

<p>Multiple UI components communicate through events fired and consumed. For example, selecting a node on a TreeGrid component fires an event that can be consumed by another component. Another example would the firing of an event which triggers an action targeting the same component or another component. What triggers an action, what the action logic is, and what component is impacted/updated by the action are all configured via the Action node.</p>

<p>Actions node has no properties of its own.</p>

<h4><a name="Actions-AvailableActions"></a>Available Actions</h4>
<p><b>Add FunctionAction</b>: Adds a new function action to invoke a function of another UI component.<br/>
<b>Add MergeAction</b>: Adds a new merge action to make a server-side call and merge the results returned with the data of a UI component.<br/>
<b>Add RequestAction</b>: Adds a new request action to make a server-side call.<br/>
<b>Add LinkAction</b>: Adds a new link action to redirect to the specified URL.</p>

<h2><a name="Actions-ActionConfigurationKeyConcepts"></a>Action Configuration Key Concepts</h2>
<p>An action consists of the following 3 parts:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Type of the action</li>
	<li>What triggers the action</li>
	<li>What the action should do</li>
</ol>


<h5><a name="Actions-ActionTypes"></a>Action Types</h5>
<p>RapidInsight UI components support various actions such as making a server-side call on a node clicked event, making a function call to another UI component based on a menu click, etc. To support these different behaviors, multiple action types are supported:<br/>
<b>request</b>: When triggered, this action will make a server side call.<br/>
<b>merge</b>: When triggered, this action will make a server side call (specified by the url field) and update its own data or the data of another component (merge the data it has with the data returned from the server).<br/>
<b>link</b>: redirects to a URL based on the link clicked in a UI Component.<br/>
<b>function</b>: When triggered, this action will invoke a function of another UI component.</p>

<h5><a name="Actions-TriggerType"></a>Trigger Type</h5>
<p>The first step in creating an action is to define its trigger. In RapidInsight there are 4 types of events that can trigger an action. These trigger types are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Menu: action will be triggered when a menu item is clicked</li>
	<li>Component event: action will be triggered when an event supported by a component is fired, such as "rowClicked" event of the SearchGrid</li>
	<li>Action event: action will be triggered by an event fired by a preceding action, such as the "success" event of the FunctionAction</li>
	<li>Global event: action will be triggered when a global event is fired, such as serverDown, which indicates communication to the server is lost.</li>
</ul>


<p>Multiple triggers can be defined for an action.</p>

<h5><a name="Actions-SpecifywhattheActionshoulddo"></a>Specify what the Action should do</h5>
<p>This specification is done through the properties of the action and sometimes configuring additional child nodes of the action, such as RequestParameters for the MergeAction, or the target component and its function to be invoked.</p>

<h5><a name="Actions-DatatobePassedbetweenComponents"></a>Data to be Passed between Components</h5>
<p>In order to make sure that the action does something with in the context of what is clicked, what menu on which row is selected, etc. event data on the selected UI item must be made available to the action. Typically, the documentation pane in the lower right quadrant will display what data will be available for each trigger defined. Also, as the data to be passed in to the server-side script, or component function is defined, the documentation pane will again show all available data for all the triggers defined for the particular action.</p>
