// This script is executed by Grails during application upgrade ('grails upgrade' command).
// This script is a Gant script so you can use all special variables
// provided by Gant (such as 'baseDir' which points on project base dir).
// You can use 'Ant' to access a global instance of AntBuilder
//
// For example you can create directory under project tree:
// Ant.mkdir(dir:"D:\Workspace\RapidModules/RapidUI/grails-app/jobs")
//

Ant.property(environment:"env")
